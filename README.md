# Original Reflexion Implementation

### This is outdated: the main repository is located at [https://github.com/noahshinn/reflexion](https://github.com/noahshinn/reflexion)

Code for the approach first proposed in [Reflexion: an autonomous agent with dynamic memory and self-reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366)

### Note
Reflexion is not a replacement for [ReAct](https://github.com/ysymyth/ReAct) or any other decision-guiding approach! It is a simple retry technique that can be used enhance other approaches.

Check out the original [blog post](https://nanothoughts.substack.com/p/reflecting-on-reflexion) here.

Check out an interesting type-inference implementation [OpenTau](https://github.com/GammaTauAI/opentau) that uses a variation of Reflexion to play a 2-player game with type-checker.
